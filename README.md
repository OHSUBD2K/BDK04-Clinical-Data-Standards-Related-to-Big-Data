## A note on Figures and Images

Nothing makes a learning session more engaging than fabulous visuals.  While many in the education realm are accustomed to using a variety of rich images under the educational use exception, materials presented in an online educational resource (OER) format that are freely available and allow for users to remix, tweak and build upon the OERs present a unique problem.  Images used in these circumstances must carry stringent **CC BY-NC-SA (Creative Commons: Attribution – Non-Commercial – Share Alike)** copyright.

As a result, the materials provided here have limited imagery as we intend for the users to remix, tweak and make these modules their own.  At points in this module I have suggested inserting images of your choosing, not only to help create visual interest, but also to help tailor the educational experience to your audience.  For examples, images that are being produced by researchers on your campus or in your department will drive a point home more effectively than generic or stock photos.

**How does all of this copyright stuff work?**  For more information on copyright and fair use, I recommend a couple of resources.

- The Stanford Copyright and Fair Use page is very straightforward: http://fairuse.stanford.edu  Of particular use is the “Academic and Education Permissions” section.  
- Dr. Kenneth Cruse is an internationally known copyright expert, and he established the Copyright Advisory Office at Columbia University.  The Copyright Advisory Office provides excellent explanations and worksheets: https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics.html 
- For more information on Creative Commons licenses, please see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/

**When should you look to add additional images?**  When you see the clipboard icon, please consider identifying relevant images to the presentation.  Suggested images may be hyperlinked, but not embedded in the presentation.  Use your creativity when identifying images!  

**Where do I find images?** There are several sources that might be available to you.  Depending on how you plan on using the BD2K modules, you may have more flexibility to locate images.  Once you have identify the license that you wish to use, you can search with those restrictions in mind.

- Google Images:  Head to [Google Advanced Image Search](http://www.google.com/advanced_image_search) and under the “usage rights” filter, select the filter that matches your requirements.
- Flickr Creative Commons:  Many users of Flickr have elected to allow their photographs to be reused.  To browse or search for CC licensed images, head to https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/  
- Institutional licenses: depending on your home institution, your library may subscribe to an image database that may be useful.  Please consult with your librarian to see if such assets are available to you.
